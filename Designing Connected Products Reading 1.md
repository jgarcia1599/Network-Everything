In this book, the authors delved into the concept of designing UX/UI for interconnected devices under an Internet of Things future. The main argument the book set forth during the first chapters  was that UX, or user experience, is going to be very different for interconnected devices as it involves a lot of moving pieces working synchronously for the user. As such, UX designers of the future must have a deep understanding of the complexity that interconnected devices entail in order to make products that not only achieve the technical feat of being interconnected but also do so in a way that actually makes the experience of the user more enyojable and useful. 
     
  I felt that the writers had a negative outlook for achieveing good UX for interconnected products as there might be a lot of technical difficulties that prevent the experience from being enjoyable (i.e. interconnectivity between products is too slow). However, being a Computer Scientist and IoT enthusiast myself, I believe that these difficulties will be overcomed (assuming that they havent been overcomed yet)and they would not need to be considered in the future. Interconnectivity technologies like 5g will allow for all products to be connected to the internet and provide feedback and response in real-time. However, I do agree that these difficulties should at least be considered by designers as they must work with the technologies, and there issues therein, that currently exist in order to perfect the UX and matched with its technological back-end.
