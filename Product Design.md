Project Idea: Speaker that plays music based on your mood. Mood can be detected through the user’s heartbeat (a wristband)
Define a product
///
What is the value proposition? What problem does it solve? (pg. 112) 
The Value Proposition of any device or product is a characteristic which makes it attractive to consumers. The value proposition of this device is that it is designed to emotionally please to the user. The power of appealing to ethos, one of the most powerful tools, is harnessed by this device as it listens to what the user wants/feels, and plays a song to create an ambiance which mirrors what the user feels internally.  
What is the target market? (pg. 121)
	The primary target audience would be limited to people who generally appreciate music. Specific interest in a specific genre is not required since the device would be able to play music corresponding to the user’s momentary mood. Therefore, an audience would require that people generally like music and appreciate the mood which music can produce. 
Is it a product or a tool? Is it a service? (pg. 124)
	This product provides a service to the user, and enhances their day to day experience. It is definitely not a tool which a customer needs in his or her life, nor does it facilitate essential daily activities. However, it serves to enhance the consumer’s mood. 
Define the actors and stakeholders (pg. 154, 157, 159)
	The actors would be the people that design the algorithm which dictates which music plays according to one’s mood. The stakeholders in this context would be the users which listen to the music from the speakers as well as the artists who contribute their music to be played on this product. 
What is the context? (pg 162-168
The operational context of the device would the actual speaker and the wristband the user would use in order to change its mood. The speaker would ideally be small enough for the user to carry around and use it whenever necessary. The wristband muyst have customizable to fit with the user’s style choice. 
The behavioral context would be the time and space in which the user needs to use the device and change its mood. Given that our device would cause a behavior change based on the mood of the user, this context is customizable depending on the situation the user is in. 

Research
What questions would you ask in an interview? (pg. 171)
Do you use music to elicit a particular type of mood change or reinforce a desired mood that you prefer? If so, what music do you listen to when: 
You are happy?
You are sad?
You are afraid? 
You are disgusted?
You are angry?
You are surprised
(6 basic types of human emotions-Robert Plutchik)

How would you approach making? What would you make? What method would you use? (pg. 178)
We would use the “do just enough” approach proposed by researcher Erika Hall. With this approach, we would gather “enough” information regarding music, mood changes, and their relationships to the human body (heart beat) to quickly prototype and user test. In both our research and prototyping stages, we would incorporate as much user feedback as possible in order to make a product that is not only technologically adept,but is useful to our target audience.
