The Super Alarm    
Using the Arduino MKR 1010, a simple website interface using Node.js, and an Arduino mini speaker I was thinking of creating a super alarm that solves the issue of all heavy sleepers out there. The web interface will display a clock and will allow the user to set an alarm. The program will then calculate the number of hours the user sleeps and according to that will display tones of different levels of intensity depending on the amount of sleep. For example, anything less than 4 hours of sleep will create a super high-pitched sound and anything more than 4 hours will create a lower-pitched sound.
